# MASTER_SVC Backend Logging

This directory is used to store log files generated by the MASTER_SVC backend service.

## How Logging Works
- Log files are written to this directory by the Django logging configuration in `config/settings.py`.
- By default, logs are written to `django.log` in this folder.
- You can configure log levels, formats, and handlers in the Django settings.
